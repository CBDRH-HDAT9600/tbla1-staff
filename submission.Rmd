### Housekeeping

1. `r emo::ji("video")` Cameras and recording 

1. `r emo::ji("question")` Tutorial questions: names list 

1. `r emo::ji("team")` Team formation and communication 
    * There is a Discussion feature in GitHub. Visible to class admin FYI. 
    * Welcome to set up private Teams group or use other platforms. 
    * Need to think about how to handle collaboration on shared project (Git commit example)
    
1. `r emo::ji("computer")` Tutorial packages 
    * Deployed online
    * Accessible locally 
    * Source code on GitHub

### TBLA Submissions

#### `r emo::ji("rocket")` Highlights 

* Updating title info (e.g. authors/dates)  
* Everyone embraced ggplot, lots of nice use of colour! `r emo::ji("graph")`
* Sensible graph choices.
* Using units of measurement; sensible and consistent choice for number of decimal places. 

> Weight ranged from 32.2kg to 117.0kg, with a median weight of 69.5kg and inter-quartile range of 61.0 to 78.6kg.

> Age ranged from 16 to 80 years, with a median of 39 years and inter-quartile range of 28 to 49 years.

* Please never say (for example) weight was 70.34522. That level of precision is meaningless, and makes it more difficult to digest. 

* Using absolute and relative frequencies to summarise data.  

> There were 434 non-smokers and 185 smokers in the data set out of 619 people. About 30% of the population in the data set were the smokers.

#### `r emo::ji("mountain")` Opportunities to improve 

* Make sure to read the instructions carefully! (e.g. "Delete this in your submission" instruction)  
* Output with no comments  
* Output where **formatting has failed_
* Mindful of missing data, e.g. cholesterol missing 266 observations

### Overview

The three key variables I will select are

1. Systolic blood pressure (`systol`)
1. Body Mass index (`bmi`)
1. Sex (`sex`)  

Below I examine the univariate distribution for each variable and the three bivariate relationships. 

### Univariate analysis

#### Systolic blood pressure

```{r}

summary(hr$systol)

ggplot(data = hr, aes(x=systol)) + 
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 10, color = 'darkblue', fill = 'lightblue') +
  labs(x = "Systolic blood pressure (mmHg)",
       y = "Count",
       title = "Systolic blood pressure")

```


**Interpretation:**  
Systolic blood pressure is normally distributed with a with a median of 132 mmHg and inter-quartile range of 121 to 143 mmHg and a range from 70 to 200 mmHg. 

#### BMI

```{r}
summary(hr$bmi)

ggplot(data = hr, aes(x=bmi)) + 
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, color = 'darkblue', fill = 'lightblue') +
  labs(x = bquote("BMI"~(kg/m^2)),
       y = "Count",
       title = "Body Mass Index")

```


**Interpretation:**  
Body mass index was approximately normally distributed with a mean of 24.2 kg/m^2^ and an interquartile range of 21.8 - 26.0 kg/m^2^. There was a long right tail with a range from 17.0 - 43.3 kg/m^2^. The records were missing information on BMI. 

#### Sex

```{r}
table(hr$sex)
table(hr$sex)/nrow(hr)

ggplot(data = hr, aes(x=sex)) + 
  geom_bar(color = 'darkblue', fill = 'lightblue') +
  labs(x = NULL,
       y = "Count",
       title = "Sex")

```


**Interpretation:**  
The dataset included 273 women (44%) and 346 men (56%).

### Bivariate analyses

#### Systolic blood pressure and BMI

```{r}

ggplot(data = hr, aes(x = bmi, y = systol)) +
  geom_point() + 
    labs(x = bquote("BMI"~(kg/m^2)),
       y = "Systolic blood pressure (mmHg)",
       title = "Systolic blood pressure and BMI")

```
**Interpretation:**  
There appears to be a slight positive association between systolic blood pressure and BMI. The correlation between the two variables was `r round(cor(hr$systol, hr$bmi, use = 'complete.obs'), digits = 2)`.

#### Systolic blood pressure and sex

```{r}

ggplot(data = hr, aes(x = systol, y = sex)) +
  geom_boxplot() + 
    labs(x = "Systolic blood pressure (mmHg)",
       y = "Sex",
       title = "Systolic blood pressure and sex")

```

**Interpretation:**  

The men in this sample had slightly higher blood pressure (`r round(mean(hr$systol[hr$sex=='male']))` mmHg on average) compared to women (`r round(mean(hr$systol[hr$sex=='female']))` mmHg on average).


#### Sex and BMI

```{r}

ggplot(data = hr, aes(x = bmi, y = sex)) +
  geom_boxplot() + 
    labs(x = bquote("BMI"~(kg/m^2)),
       y = "Sex",
       title = "BMI and sex")

```

**Interpretation:**  

The men in this sample had slightly higher BMI (`r round(mean(hr$bmi[hr$sex=='male'], na.rm = T), digits = 1)` kg/m^2^ on average) compared to women (`r round(mean(hr$bmi[hr$sex=='female'], na.rm = T), digits = 1)` kg/m^2^ on average).


*** 

### Multivariate summary

```{r}

ggplot(hr, aes(bmi, systol, group = sex, color = sex, fill = sex, shape = sex)) + 
  geom_point(alpha = .6) +
  labs(x = bquote("BMI"~(kg/m^2)), y = "Systolic blood pressure (mmHg)") +
  theme(legend.position = c(.88, .85), legend.background = element_rect(fill="transparent"), legend.title = element_text(size = 0))


```

**Interpretation:**  
There appears to be a positive relationship between BMI and systolic blood pressure for both men and women, although men tend to have a higher BMI overall.
